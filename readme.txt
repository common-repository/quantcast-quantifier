== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where is the Quantcast Quantifier code displayed? =

The Quantcast Quantifier code is added to the <head> section of your theme by default. If you choose the footer option it should display somewhere near the bottom before the </html>.
 
= Why don't I see the Quantcast Quantifier code on my website? =

If you have switched off admin logging, you will not see the code. You can try enabling it temporarily or log out of your WordPress account to see if the code is displaying.

= Do I need a Quantcast Account =
Yes, you will need to visit Quantcast and signup to receive tracking code for your website.
